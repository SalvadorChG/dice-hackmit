# Dice-HackMIT 22 / Panera's  Hack for a healthier and happier world 

We are a diverse team coming from different universities in the US and Latin America majoring in computer science, math, engineering physics, and data science. During this short period of time, we've had a whale of time working on our project, learning new things, broadening our knowledge in areas that we didn’t know before, and challenging ourselves. 

Everytime we hang out with my friends, they never know what they want to do and we spend way too much time trying to figure that out. Therefore, during this Hackathon, we came up with the idea to develop an app called 'Dice' for the Panera's challenge. Dice was born out of a desire to tackle that indecisiveness and improve on the experience of going out, whether it's on your own or with others. 
 

Dice is an app that encourages people to be adventurous and make meaningful memories by generating valuable activities that support local communities, small businesses, personal well-being, and comprehensive sustainability. With a bank of options curated from around your area, our platform promotes the betterment of you and your environment—all with the roll of a dice. 

Mission:  

Dice fulfills our desires to have fun and make memories while also contributing to the prosperity of our surroundings in return. Every activity we curate has an ulterior value in mind—from the cultural significance of family-owned restaurants to the environmental sustainability of second-hand shopping. Furthermore, Dice is our way of promoting outside interaction rather than staying trapped inside the tech-bubble to entertain ourselves. Ultimately, we are an app that is pushing towards a happier, healthier world.
