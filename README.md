# Dice-hackmit 22
HackMIT 2022 Project

Dice is an app that encourages people to be adventurous and make meaningful memories by generating valuable activities that support local communities, small businesses, personal well-being, and comprehensive sustainability. With a bank of options curated from around your area, our platform promotes the betterment of you and your environment—all with the roll of a dice. 

Mission:  

Dice fulfills our desires to have fun and make memories while also contributing to the prosperity of our surroundings in return. Every activity we curate has an ulterior value in mind—from the cultural significance of family-owned restaurants to the environmental sustainability of second-hand shopping. Furthermore, Dice is our way of promoting outside interaction rather than staying trapped inside the tech-bubble to entertain ourselves. Ultimately, we are an app that is pushing towards a happier, healthier world.
