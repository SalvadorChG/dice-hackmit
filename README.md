# Dice-HackMIT 22 / Panera's  Hack for a healthier and happier world 

Dice is an app that encourages people to be adventurous and make meaningful memories by generating valuable activities that support local communities, small businesses, personal well-being, and comprehensive sustainability. With a bank of options curated from around your area, our platform promotes the betterment of you and your environment—all with the roll of a dice. 

Our project was inspired by how everytime we hang out with our friends, they never know what they want to do, and we spend way too much time trying to decide. Therefore, Dice was born out of a desire to tackle that indecisiveness and improve on the experience of going out, whether it's on your own or with others. By also focusing on the wellbeing of the communities around us, Dice was our solution to Panera’s challenge for a happy and healthier world. 

About Us: We are a diverse team coming from different universities in the US and Latin America majoring in computer science, math, engineering physics, and data science. During these 24 hours, it’s undoubtedly been a big challenge realizing our ideas, but this hackathon has proved valuable to all of us, broadening our knowledge in unfamiliar areas and pushing us to work towards new heights.

Details about Dice:

Mission: Dice fulfills your desires to have fun and make memories while also contributing to the prosperity of your surroundings in return. Every activity we curate has an ulterior value in mind—from the cultural significance of family-owned restaurants to the environmental sustainability of second-hand shopping. Furthermore, Dice is our way of promoting outside interaction rather than staying trapped inside the tech-bubble to entertain ourselves. Ultimately, we are an app that is pushing towards a happier, healthier world. 

General Utility: When opening the Dice app, you are first presented with the most popular activities and other suggested activities. To get an activity, you tap on the bold dice in the top right corner to either immediately generate an activity or “pick a side.” When you “pick a side,” you select a category and receive a filtered random activity. There are also other tabs where you have your own profile and where you can browse a photo feed to see your friend’s adventures.

Resources used: We used the resources Flutter, Figma, and Notion. 

What We Learned: We learned about the importance of clear and effective communication in order to prevent miscommunication and wasted time, the challenging, yet valuable, experience of diving into unfamiliar software like Flutter.
